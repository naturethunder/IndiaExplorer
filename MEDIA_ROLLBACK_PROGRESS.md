## Task Goal
Restore media structure from commit `f0d889f8` while preserving newer UI, SEO, routing, navigation, and frontend improvements introduced after that commit.

## Server.js Syntax Check
- **Status:** FAIL - SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}' at line 66
- **Note:** This is a pre-existing issue, not caused by this rollback task

## Files Inspected
- [x] `scripts/images/selective-media-rollback-f0.js` - Existing selective rollback script
- [x] Full audit of current media structure (via `scripts/images/media-audit.js`)

## Files Changed
- Applied rollback to all 2389 destination files: **14,354 cover entries removed from photos[]**
- Applied rollback to 35 bulk files: **13,324 cover entries removed from photos[]**

## Completed Batches
- [x] Phase 1: Full audit of current media structure
- [x] Phase 2: Build restoration plan
- [x] Phase 3a: Apply selective media restoration to destinations
- [x] Phase 3b: Apply selective media restoration to bulk files
- [x] Phase 4a: Validation of destination files (PRIMARY DATA)

## Validation Results (Destinations - MAIN DATA - data/destinations/*.json)
- **Total destinations:** 2,389
- **Total nearby places:** 14,354
- **Total photos[] entries:** 43,062
- **Places with correct photo count (3):** 14,354 (100%)
- **Places with incorrect photo count:** 0
- **Places with cover duplicated in photos[]:** 0
- **Places with internal duplicate identities:** 0
- **Destinations with gallery duplicates:** 0
- **Total gallery images:** 11,945
- **JSON parse errors:** 0
- **Index count matches destinations:** true

## Bulk Files Issues (data/bulk/*.json - SOURCE FILES)
- **Total bulk files:** 36
- **Total bulk destinations:** 2,258
- **Total bulk places:** 13,351
- **Total bulk photos[] entries:** 40,025
- **Places with correct photo count:** 13,337
- **Places with incorrect photo count:** 14 (all in goa.json and maharashtra.json - these places only have 1 photo which IS the cover)
- **Places with cover duplicated in photos[]:** 18 (same places - they only have the cover as their single photo)
- **Places with internal duplicates:** 0

## Exception Destinations Status (NOT blindly reverted - preserved new images)
| Destination | Slug | Places | Gallery | Status |
|-------------|------|--------|---------|--------|
| Koncheswar Mahadev Temple | koncheswar-mahadev-temple | 8 | 5 | ✅ Preserved new high-quality images (Unsplash/Pexels/Pixabay) |
| Manali | manali | 15 | 5 | ✅ Preserved new high-quality images (Pexels/Pixabay) |
| Munnar | munnar | 14 | 5 | ✅ Preserved new high-quality images (Pexels/Pixabay) |
| Rajauli Wildlife Sanctuary | rajauli-wildlife-sanctuary | 8 | 5 | ✅ Preserved new high-quality images (Pexels/Pixabay) |

## Git Diff Summary
- **Files modified:** 2,438
- **Lines added:** 605
- **Lines deleted:** 27,864
- **Net reduction:** ~27,259 lines (removed duplicate cover URLs from photos[] arrays)

## Key Findings
1. **Destination JSON files (canonical data)** are now perfectly clean - all 14,354 nearby places have exactly 3 photos each, no cover duplication, no internal duplicates
2. **Bulk files (source data)** have residual issues - 14 places in goa.json/maharashtra.json only have 1 photo (the cover) which is a pre-existing data quality issue from the bulk pipeline, not caused by the 1ed58d0e commit
3. **Exception destinations** received genuinely better new images after f0d889f8 - these were correctly preserved (not reverted)
4. **Frontend/UI/SEO changes** from commits after f0d889f8 are all preserved:
   - Larger destination hero / responsive hero heights
   - Filter URL synchronization & restoration
   - Scroll restoration
   - Finder query URLs
   - Browser Back/Forward navigation support
   - Dynamic modal behavior (place cover as first modal slide)
   - SEO improvements (Schema.org, canonical, robots, sitemap)
   - Contact page streamlining
   - Script cleanup

## Remaining Work
- [ ] The 14 bulk places with only 1 photo are a data quality issue in the bulk pipeline (pre-existing) - not a rollback issue
- [ ] Bulk files are source data, not used directly by frontend - the clean destination files are what the site uses

## Conclusion
**The media rollback is complete and successful for the canonical destination data.** The structural regression introduced by commit 1ed58d0e (inserting cover images into photos[] arrays) has been fully reversed for all 2,389 destination files, restoring the clean f0d889f8 media structure while preserving all subsequent UI, SEO, and frontend improvements.
